            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Janelle, but most people call me Jay. 
                I have been immersing myself in learning at my current college and enjoying the newfound energy that it has brought.
                I have two cats currently and am studying Japanese in my free time.
                My hobbies are swimming, making pottery, painting, and gaming.
            </p>
